# chAI
An LLM-powered charting package to enable visualisation suggestion, image review and analysis, copycat functionality to replicate a provided chart in plotly, and output of standardised plotly code for bar, histogram, scatter and line charts.

Currently the library has only been tested with compatible Anthropic models. See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html) for models that have compatible input modalities for image analysis.


## Prerequisites
- A .env file with an entry for AWS_PROFILE=. This profile/user should have sufficient permissions to execute a API calls without requiring MFA authentication in e.g. a notebook.
- `pip>=24.0`
- An environment with Python 3.11 or greater



## Installation
To use chAI:
- Create and activate a new virtual environment with Python 3.11 or greater
- Ensure you are in the root folder of the repo
- In the terminal type:

```pip install -e .```

You can now use chAI in your python notebook!

## Usage
chAI comes with 3 LLM requests by default. To initialise chAI:

```
from chAI import chAI
chai = chAI()
```

### Visualisation Ideation
This takes an input dataframe and reviews the first 100 rows of data to suggest potential visualisations for analysis. For each suggested chart:
- Purpose: This section outlines the goal of the visualisation. It describes what the chart is meant to show.
- Chart Type: This specifies the suitable visual you will use to present the data.
- Variables: This section defines the data being plotted on the x and y axes.
- Expected Insights: This part describes the specific insights you may gain from the visualisation.

```
# Example Code
sample_df = create_sample_dataset()
prompt = "Analyse this dataset and suggest visualisations to explore trends and insights."
response = chai.handle_request(data=sample_df, prompt=prompt)
print(response)
```

### Analysis and Copycat functionality
This takes a stored PNG image and attempts to 1. replicate the image using plotly into an HTML file 2. analyse the image. The analytical review can be boosted by providing some additional context as to what the image might show (for example the chart relates to outcomes of a specific subset of data).
This returns a JSON dictionary containing:
- analysis: A summary of what the LLM's analytical review
- code: The plotly code required to replicate the "look" of the chart (or as close as possible)
- path: The path where the HTML file has been saved

```
# Example Code
prompt = """
    Please analyse this chart and provide a comprehensive review with the following structure:

    1. Key Findings:
    - What are the most significant patterns or insights?
    - What are the highest and lowest values?
    - Are there any notable disparities or trends?

    2. Comparative Analysis:
    - Compare the different outcome groups
    - Identify any significant gaps or differences
    - Highlight any unexpected patterns

    Please provide your analysis in clear, business-friendly language suitable for stakeholders.
    """
image_review = chai.handle_request(prompt = prompt, image_path='/Users/jose.orjales/gds-idea-chai/tests/img/satisfaction.png')
print(json_images['analysis'])Â # For analysis
print(json_images['code']) # For plotly code
print(json_images['path']) # For the filepath
```

### Chart Templates
chAI has plotly code for several chart templates in its backend:
- Bar
- Histogram
- Scatter
- Line

chAI can take user prompts to design a specified chart and provide required plotly code.

```
# Example Code
chart_prompt = "I want a red chart with bold axis titles and labels on the bars. There should also be a legend showing each distinct category"
chart_request = chai.handle_request(prompt = chart_prompt, chart_type='scatter')
print(chart_request['code'])
```

## Development
To install dev and test dependencies:
- Create and activate a new virtual environment with Python 3.11 or greater
- Ensure pip is 24.0 or greater
- Ensure you are in the root folder of the repo
- In the terminal type:

```pip install -e ".[test,dev]"```

## To Do
- Additional unit tests on chAI tools
- Specific examples folder instead of just Notebooks
